# Set root logger level to DEBUG and its only appender to A1.
# ALL	All levels including custom levels.
# DEBUG	Designates fine-grained informational events that are most useful to debug an application.
# INFO	Designates informational messages that highlight the progress of the application at coarse-grained level.
# WARN	Designates potentially harmful situations.
# ERROR	Designates error events that might still allow the application to continue running.
# FATAL	Designates very severe error events that will presumably lead the application to abort.
# OFF	The highest possible rank and is intended to turn off logging.
# TRACE	Designates finer-grained informational events than the DEBUG.
